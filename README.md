# 26.array2
This program computes the average of a series of test scores.
If you run it you should see 86.6.
Let's walk through the program: • First we create an array of length 5 to hold our test scores, then we fill up each element with a grade
• Next we setup a for loop to compute the total score
• Finally we divide the total score by the number of elements to find the average
